Welcome to **100 Mini Python Projects**! This repository is a journey through 100 practical, fun, and challenging Python projects. Whether you are a beginner looking to understand the basics or an intermediate developer wanting to sharpen your problem-solving skills, this collection has something for everyone.

## 🚀 Goals of this Repo
* **Build Muscle Memory:** Reinforce syntax and core concepts through repetition.
* **Diverse Applications:** Explore different domains like automation, games, web scraping, and data handling.
* **Portfolio Ready:** Create a library of working code to showcase your skills.

## 📂 Project Structure

Each project is contained in its own folder (or file) with a descriptive name. Inside, you will typically find:
* `main.py` (The source code)
* `requirements.txt` (If external libraries are needed)
* `README.md` (Specific instructions for that project)
